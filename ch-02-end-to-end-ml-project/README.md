## Chapter 2: End to End ML Project

This chapter focuses on applying rudimentary knowledge of statistical models to predict house pricing. You will find notes I made of this chapter inside the [notes](./notes.md) file.

### Running

-   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv && source ./venv/bin/activate
    ```

-   Install requirements:

    ```sh
    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-   Start Jupyter Notebook Server:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```
