1. Loss in Machine Learning helps us understand the performance of a model by comparing the difference between its predicted value and the actual value.
2. The function used to quantify this loss is conveniently called the 'Loss Function'.
3. Loss function is used to refer to the loss in a single training example.
4. The cost function is the average of loss functions across the entire training dataset.
5. A hypothesis function is one that takes input and produces output (predictions).
6. In Machine Learning, vectors are often represented using column vectors. 2D arrays with a single column. The reason for this is consistency, especially regarding matrix multiplication.
7. The most common metric for evaluating regression models is the RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), which is basically the average of the difference between the predicted and true values squared. root( avg[(y - y_pred) ^ 2] ).
8. ML algorithms generally optimize a different loss function during training simply because it's easier to do so. The loss functions used during training and evaluation may or may not always be the same.
9. Ridge Regression - also known as L2 Regularization is used to correct for multi co-linearity.
